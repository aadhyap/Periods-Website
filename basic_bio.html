                <p> Fallopian Tube: The tube an egg travels down to get to the uterus. If an egg is to be fertilized, this is where the sperm will combine with the egg and form a zygote </p>
                <p> Uterus: Also known as the womb, this is where a fetilized egg develops into a fetus during pregnancy. </p>
                <p> Ovary: The small glands on opposite sides of the uterus which contains eggs before they are released into the Fallopian Tubes </p>
                <p> Endometrium: The inner lining of the uterus which thickens during the mentsrual cycle in order to prepare to support a fetilized egg's growth into a fetus </p>
                <p> Cervix: The tissue that connects the vagina and the uterus</p>
                <p> Vagina: The tube that connects the cervix to the outside of the body. This is how a baby exits the mother during childbirth and how blood exits during menstration </p>
                <p> Vulva: The name of all the external female genitalia in the pubic region, including the mons pubis, the labia majora, the labia minora, and the clotoris </p>

            <h3> Stage 1: The Period </h3>
                <p> The uterus sheds its lining. This is the beginning of the menstrual cycle. During this time, a woman bleeds about 30-40 mls (about 5 to 10 teaspoons of blood) and experiences cramps. This stage usually lasts from two to seven days with the beginning days having the heaviest bleeding and most painful cramps. A period is considered heavy if the woman bleeds over 60 mls. About 90% of women bleed less than 80 mls during their period. </p>
            <h3> Stage 2: Preparing the next egg </h3>
                <p> A new egg gets prepared to be released from the ovary and the uterus lining beings to thicken in preparation for a fertilized egg to attach grow into a fetus. The thickening of the uterus occurs whether or not the egg will be fertilized later. </p>
            <h3> Stage 3: Ovulation </h3>
                <p> The egg is released from the ovary in a process called ovulation. During this time some women experience one sided cramps known as middleschmertz, the German word for “middle pain”.</p>
            <h3> Stage 4: Traveling down the Fallopian Tube </h3>
                <p> The egg continues down the fallopian tube on its way to the uterus which is continually thickening. </p>
            <h3> Stage 5: Enter the uterus </h3>
                <p> The egg reaches the uterus. If the egg is fertilized it will attach to the uterus wall and begin development. If not, the cycle begins again at stage one: menstruation. </p>
