            <p>Cramps are caused by the muscles of a woman's uterus contracting to push out the blood soaked lining of the uterus through the vagina. This occurs during the first stage of the menstrual cycle, also known as the period. These contractions are triggered by chemicals called prostaglandins. The amount of prostaglandis affect the amount of pain one feels. </p>
            <p>Not <i>all</i> women experience cramps during their periods, but many do.</p>

            <p>There are two types of dysmenorrhea (aka period cramps) </p>
            <p> 1) Primary dysmenorrhea - This is the type of cramps are what most girls experience, they start a day or two before the beginning of the period and continue for two to four days. Pain is usually felt in the lower belly or lower back</p>
            <p> 2) Secondary dysmenorrhea - These cramps are caused by a problem in the uterus. Some examples of these are endometriosis, adenomyosis, uterine fibroids, or an infection. This pain usually begins earlier and lasts longer than common period pains. </p>

            <p>There are many different options for releaving period pain. Different solutions and combinatins of solutions work for different women because every body is different. Here are a few common remedies that can help:</p>
            <!-- List of remedies --> 
                <li align = "left">Put a heating pad or taking a warm bath: heat helps get blood flowing which can make the pain lessen </li>
                <br><li align = "left">Massaging the stomach or other aching areas </li>
                <br><li align = "left">Eating healthy: yes everyone always says to eat healthy but it can really reduce period cramp pain to eat lots of healthy fruits and vegetables and avoiding really salty foods</li>
                <br><li align = "left">Drinking lots of water: your body works better when it is hydrated which will make you feel better, especially during your period</li>
                <br><li align = "left">Medicine: medicines like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxens can reduce the pain caused by periods. Make sure that the instructions of the box are followed and if cramps are still really bad with these medicines talk to a doctor</li>
                <br><li align = "left">Exercise: though it is tempting to stay in bed forever, excersizing gets the blood flowing and will make you feel better</li>
                <br><li align = "left">Some women perfer pads during cramps instead of tampons</li>

        <div class="panel">
            <p> </p>
            <!-- Bullet pointed list of what not to do -->
            <li align = "left"> Smoking: girls who smoke are more likely to have cramps than girls who don't </li>
            <img align = "right" src = "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IuRjNi74GXU/UXffqoYXIjI/AAAAAAAACW0/v6Ra1-A7B-o/s1600/Happy+uterus.png" height = "200 px">
            <br><li align = "left"> Salty foods </li>
            <br><li align = "left"> Sugary foods </li>

            <br><li align = "left"> Alcohol </li>
            <br><li align = "left"> Fatty foods </li>
            <br><p> It can releave period cramp pain to avoid these things but having a cup of coffee or a cupcake will not leave you sobbing on the floor in the fetal position. During a period it is best to at least lessen some of the things above. </p>
