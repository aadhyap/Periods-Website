        <p>Cramps are caused by the muscles of a woman's uterus contracting to push out the blood soaked lining of the uterus through the vagina. This occurs during the first stage of the menstrual cycle, also known as the period. These contractions are triggered by chemicals called prostaglandins. The amount of prostaglandis affect the amount of pain one feels. </p>

    <h2>Types of Cramps</h2>
        <p>There are two types of dysmenorrhea (aka period cramps) </p>
        <p> 1) Primary dysmenorrhea - This is the type of cramps are what most girls experience, they start a day or two before the beginning of the period and continue for two to four days. Pain is usually felt in the lower belly or lower back</p>
        <p> 2) Secondary dysmenorrhea - These cramps are caused by a problem in the uterus. Some examples of these are endometriosis, adenomyosis, uterine fibroids, or an infection. This pain usually begins earlier and lasts longer than common period pains. </p>

        <h3> Things to avoid while on a period </h3>
            <!-- Bullet pointed list of what not to do -->
            <li> Smoking: girls who smoke are more likely to have cramps than girls who don't </li>
            <img align = "right" src = "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IuRjNi74GXU/UXffqoYXIjI/AAAAAAAACW0/v6Ra1-A7B-o/s1600/Happy+uterus.png" height = "200 px">
            <br><li> Salty foods </li>
            <br><li> Sugary foods </li>
            <br><li> Caffeine </li>
            <br><li> Alcohol </li>
            <br><li> Fatty foods </li>
            <br><p> It can releave period cramp pain to avoid these things but having a cup of coffee or a cupcake will not leave you sobbing on the floor in the fetal position. During a period it is best to at least lessen some of the things above. </p>
