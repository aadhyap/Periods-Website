        <button class="accordion">Lack of Education </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p> Many people fear talking about menstration because of the negative stigma which can make it very difficult for girls to understand what is happening to them and how they can deal with it. </p>

        <button class="accordion">The Luxury Tax</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p> The definition of a luxury good is a good that increases in demand as income rises. Basically, the more wealthy the population is, the more they spend on the good. Items concidered necessities, like food or medical supplies, escape the luxury tax. Nevertheless, period products are concidered luxuries in 40 states even though items such as ChapStick, anti-dandruff shampoo, Rogaine, and even Viagra are not. </p>
            <p> Girls don't choose to get their periods, they have to pay for them. This not only includes the luxury tax but also something known as the pink razor tax. This is not an actually tax on feminine items but research has shown that products marketed for women are more expensive than the exact same products marketed for men.</p>
            <p> These two increases in price costs women an average of 13% more on personal care than products for men. There is no reason for half of the population to pay 13% more to take care of themselves. For more information check out the links below: </p>

        <button class="accordion">Poor Access to Supplies</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <!-- Homeless women on their periods -->
            <p> Some women can't afford enough sanitary feminine hygiene products each month. Even in the US, homeless shelters often are forced to limit the number of pads and tampons given to each woman. This number often isn't enough and the women are forced to use wads of toliet paper or less sanitary options. Fortunately there are some people who are changing this: </p>

            <!-- Periods in developing countries -->
            <p> In certain developing regions women have very limited access to supplies because cultural stigmas prevent the sale and distribution of feminine products. In India only 12% of women use sanitary pads due to inadequate access to feminine products. Women are forced to use other items to manage their periods which often are unsantitary and sometimes can be fatal. Here are a few organizations fighting this: </p>

        <button class="accordion">Missing School </button>
            <div class="panel">
                <h3> The statistics: </h3>
                    <p> One out of every four girls in rural India drop out of school when they begin to get their period </p>
                    <p> In Sierra Leone more than one fifth of girls miss school because of their periods </p>
                    <p> Thirty percent of girls miss school due to their periods in Afghanistand and Nepal </p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> Many of these drop outs can be avoided if the girls are educated on how to deal with their periods and have access to enough feminine hygiene products. School is how many of these girls will be able to raise their families out of poverty, but their periods keep them from going.

                    <p> In Nepal, menstruating women are banished to cattle sheds until their periods are over, a practice called Chhaupadi </p>
                    <p> Manju Baluni's story: As a 32 year old woman from Uttarakhand, India, she told an interviewer with the BBC, "I'm not allowed into the kitchen; I can't enter the temple; I can't sit with others... My family treats me like an untouchable." </p>

            <button class = "accordion"> Resistance to Birth Control Pills</button>
                <div class = "panel">
                    <p> Birth control pills are often frowned upon because of the misconception they are only used to prevent pregnancy in sexually active women. However, birth control pills were made to effect reproductive-relative hornomes and therefore can be extremely helpful for dealing with some of the problems that occur due to the menstrual cycle. Birth control pills can be used to regulate periods, prevent extremely heavy bleeding, which can cause a woman to become anemic, prevent severe PMS symptoms, and stop or lessen other health problems which periods can sometimes cause.
