    <h3> There are now many movements and organizations working to change the following problems. Explore the blue underlined links below to see how others are making a difference and how you can help too! </h3>
    <h2> Lack of education </h2>

    <h2> The Luxury Tax </h2>
    
    <h2> Poor access to supplies </h2>
        <p> In certain developing regions women have very limited access to supplies because cultural stigmas prevent the sale and distribution of feminine products </p>
        <p> In India only 12% of women use sanitary pads due to inadequate access to feminine products </p>
        <P> Women are forced to use other items to manage their periods which often are unsantitary and sometimes can be fatal </P>

    <h2> Can't go to school or work</h2>
        <p> One out of every four girls in rural India drop out of school when they begin to get their period </p>
        <p> In Sierra Leone more than one fifth of girls miss school because of their periods </p>
        <p> Thirty percent of girls miss school due to their periods in Afghanistand and Nepal </p>
    
    <h2> Locked away because a period is seen as "dirty" </h2>
        <p> Manju Baluni's stroy: As a 32 year old woman from Uttarakhand, India, she told an interviewer with the BBC, "I'm not allowed into the kitchen; I can't enter the temple; I can't sit with others... My family treats me like an untouchable." </p>
