    <h2>Before Your Period</h2>
    “PMS” stands for Premenstrual Syndrome-- basically, symptoms that a woman or girl may have for about a week to two weeks before they start menstruating. While symptoms like mild acne or food cravings can often be personally managed, it’s important to stay in communication with your doctor about your symptoms.
            
        <h3>Common Symptoms of PMS (and how to deal):</h3>

    <h2>During Your Period</h2>
            The following three products are the three most commonly used sanitary products to prevent blood leakage. Some, like tampons and sanitary pads, can be used together. For more information, talk to your doctor.
        <h3>Sanitary Pads</h3>
            Sanitary pads in their most basic form have been used for centuries, and are still widely used today. They are also called sanitary napkins or menstrual pads, and come in many different sizes. Some women use only pads; others combine them with tampons on heavier days or only have them on hand for nighttime use. However, some women find that pads are uncomfortable or unsuitable for certain types of physical activity.

        <h3>Tampons</h3>
            Tampons, invented in the 1930s, are often chosen by women who want greater freedom in physical activities (such as swimming). As with sanitary pads, tampons are offered in various sizes and levels of absorbency. However, unlike pads, it’s highly recommended that women change their tampons at least every four to eight hours, use the lowest absorbency type, and not use tampons in between periods-- according to the National Women's Health Resource Center, Inc., “Some women may remember the connection between superabsorbent tampons and an outbreak of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) in the 1980s, but these "hyper absorbable" tampons were taken off the market and the incidence of toxic shock syndrome plummeted. However, there is some evidence that women who use tampons may have an increased risk of urinary tract infections.”

        <h3>Menstrual Cups</h3>
            Menstrual cups have been around ever since tampons were invented, and there are two kinds. The first kind is a soft, flexible, and disposable cup similar to a diaphragm. The second is a reusable bell-shaped cup made out of latex or silicone that is cleaned after use. Both types collect menstrual fluid rather than absorbing it. Some women prefer menstrual cups as tampon alternatives as they tend to leak 0.5 times less often and also can be safely worn for up to 12 hours-- allowing women to change the cup (on average) 2.8 times less frequently than when using either tampons or pads. However, some women find menstrual cups difficult to insert and remove.
