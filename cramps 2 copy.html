<h1 class = "dots">Cramps</h1>
<div class = "padding"><h2>What are Cramps?</h2>
<p>Cramps are caused because the muscle’s of a female’s uterus are contracting to help push out the blood through the vagina during her period. These contractions of the uterus are triggered by chemicals called prostaglandins in the lining of the uterus. The amount of these chemicals affect the amount of pain one feels. Girls who have relatives that have regular cramps during periods might experience cramps as well
</p>
    <h2> Pre- Menstrual Cycle (PMS) </h2>
<p> Cramps and other symptoms also occur before the menstruation cycle 
    Factors involved in PMS<br></p>
    <ol>Low levels of vitamins and mineral</ol>
    <ol>Eating a lot of salty foods, which may cause you to retain fluid</ol>
    <ol>Drinking alcohol and caffeine, which may alter your mood and energy level</ol>
